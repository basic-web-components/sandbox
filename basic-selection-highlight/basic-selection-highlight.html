This is an attempt to apply a highlight with styling.
Unfortunately, it appears too hard to try to figure out how many levels of
::content are required. And /deep/ can't help us, because we want to search
through content, not shadow trees.

<template>
  <style>
  :host /deep/ .selected {
    background-color: highlight;
    color: highlighttext;
  }
  </style>
  <content></content>
</template>
-->

<script>
Polymer(mixin(BasicAspectMixin, {

  contribute: {

    applySelection: function(item, selected) {
      item.style.backgroundColor = selected ? 'highlight' : '';
      item.style.color = selected ? 'highlighttext' : '';
    }

  },

  is: 'basic-selection-highlight'

}));
